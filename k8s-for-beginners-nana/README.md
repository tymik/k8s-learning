Here I am doing [Kubernetes Tutorial for Beginners (FULL COURSE in 4 Hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48VuDVv0do) by [TechWorld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWorldwithNana).

This is my very first attempt to get initial understanding of Kubernetes concepts.

I decided to document the code so I can return it in the future if needed to do the recap of what I was trying so far.
